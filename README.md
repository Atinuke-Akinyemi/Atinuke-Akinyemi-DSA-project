# MY STEP TO STEP GUIDE IN SOLVING A DATA ANALYTICAL PROBLEM USING EXCEL
I started by cleaning my data through the use of Power Query. 
I launch my power query and after it has loaded, I started my data cleaning by firs shortening the product name using split column using delimiter by character/space and then removing all blank spaces and Editing all my column headings with capital letters for the First letters.
After that, i calculated my Potential revenue using the formula Actual * Rating Count and Also getting my Price Range auing the formula IF(E2<1000,"Cheap",E2<=5000, "Expensive",E2>=5000,"Very Expensive")
### The image below shows the details of my Data after it was cleaned.
