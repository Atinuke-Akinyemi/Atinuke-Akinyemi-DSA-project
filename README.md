# MY STEP TO STEP GUIDE IN SOLVING A DATA ANALYTICAL PROBLEM USING EXCEL
I started by cleaning my data through shortening the product name using split column and then removing all blank spaces and starting my column headings with capital letters.
After that, i calculated my Potential revenue using the formula Actual * Rating Count and Also getting my Price Range auing the formula IF(E2<1000,"Cheap",E2<=5000, "Expensive",E2>=5000,"Very Expensive")
### The image below shows the details of my Data after it was cleaned.
